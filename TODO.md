VR experiences philosophical, configurable and remixable
------------

1. parameter to save only when matching secret
1. change documentation (README.md) to match goals rather than roles/titles
1. improve "death" animations
1. update Github with image preview
1. named (even if using hash) experiences (since the Glitch name is not sufficient)
1. keep track of parent Glitch (should be possible to set env variable via remixing link) to be able to reconstruct an experiment phylogeny 
1. better data structure in the db to include experience name and timestamp
1. add preview in configurator via iframe or images
1. try physics for "death" animations (but non deterministic)
1. networked version to get events to make sure all runs as expected
1. experiment variations
    1. impossible physics
1. add older slide on non euclydian geometry visit
